# My Portfolio Website

This is a simple **HTML-only portfolio website** created as part of my learning journey in web development following Angela Yu's Udemy course.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – Home page  
- `about.html` – About Me page  
- `contact.html` – Contact page  

All files are in the same folder for simplicity. No CSS or JavaScript has been added yet.

## Features

- Multi-page HTML site
- Navigation menu linking between pages
- Beginner-friendly structure, easy to upgrade later
- Placeholder sections for About Me and Contact information

## Future Upgrades

As I progress through the course, I plan to:

- Add CSS for styling
- Include images and profile picture
- Add a projects page
- Improve layout and design
- Add interactive elements with JavaScript
